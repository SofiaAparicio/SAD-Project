### Second Delivery
Classification Supervised exploration, classification, has to be done by training classification models through KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees and Neural Networks. For this purpose, the use of class attributes is mandatory. Evaluation of the obtained models should be done as usual, through accuracy measures and evaluation charts, as studied in the classes.
